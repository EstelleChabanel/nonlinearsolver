/** \brief Daughter class and mother class for the different Newton methods for 1D non linear equation solving
  * This class is for the Newton solving methods for non linear equation of type
  * f(x) = 0, with f and x 1D only. This super class was implemented in the perspective of implementing other newton
  * methods (methods using the derivative of the function).
