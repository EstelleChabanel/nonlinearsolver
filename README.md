# **Non Linear System Solver**
  
   
This repository contains the implementation of a numerical non linear systems solver. Several numerical methods are implemented in C++: the bisection method, the chord method, the classic Newton and the modified Newton for simple non linear equations. The Newton method is also implemented for systems of equations. Finally, the Aitken acceleration method for the equation solver algorithms is also proposed.

First, the user can find a brief guide to install and use the program. Then, the architecture choices and the different methods used in the implementation are presented more precisely.
